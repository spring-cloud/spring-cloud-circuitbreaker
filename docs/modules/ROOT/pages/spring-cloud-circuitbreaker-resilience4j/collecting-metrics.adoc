= Collecting Metrics
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker Resilience4j includes auto-configuration to setup metrics collection as long as the right
dependencies are on the classpath.  To enable metric collection you must include `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator`, and `io.github.resilience4j:resilience4j-micrometer`.  For more information on the metrics that
get produced when these dependencies are present, see the https://resilience4j.readme.io/docs/micrometer[Resilience4j documentation].

NOTE:  You don't have to include `micrometer-core` directly as it is brought in by `spring-boot-starter-actuator`
